	The following are the Open issues that have been closed over the last 5 days.
	We now have Steve Giron working triaging the bugs. He has gone through all open bugs (>90) and
	closed bugs where the
		1) problem is now fixed,
		2) closed the bugs if they were trivial (with the original users input), or
		3) we actually know we fixed the bug (you would see dan or gil as commenting on bug) or
		4) We document that it is not a bug but is performing as it was designed.
		5) Bug closed because it is a duplicate of another bug
	If you see an issue closed that you think is still an issue, please re-open the issue.

4.0.30  May 13, 2015
  NOTES FROM DEVELOPMENT
	(Dkulp) * Detect ramp up/down when converting to effects
	(Dkulp) * IF the effects panels are disabled (for example, while rendering and saving),
		we cannot update the effect as disabling the controls changes the effect strings.
	(Gil) * Draw Timing lines last. This makes a timing grid look better when selecting 25,50ms.
	(Gil) * Use original effect duration for paste if no timing track is active.
	(dkulp) * Fix problem of "To Center" checkbox on text always being turned off
	(dkulp) * Add the alpha channel handling to text effect
	(dkulp) * Re-render range when effect moves
	(dkulp) * More slider<->text updates. Dan is adding text boxes to all effects that have sliders. This allows entering exact values

    -test (dkulp) Try flipping to a busy wait for TextEffect rendering to see if that prevents some crashes/hangs
    -enh (dkulp) RenderPictures now has a 20FPS check box so rendering can just advance per frame if the movie is already in 20fps.
		If unchecked, the "Speed" slider adjusts the speed (with 10 being "normal", <10 slower, >10 faster). A speed of 10 = 20fps.
3.6.11 Dec 4, 2014
    -enh (dkulp) Add a "Settings" menu.  First setting: ability to disable the multi-threaded saves.
			When disable, all is rendered on the main thread.  Slower, but maybe safer.
			With this change, there are now four ways to save
			1) Normal - threaded
			2) Normal + Fast Save - threaded but only rendering the stuff that has changed
			3) Threading disabled (settings menu) - all rendering is on the main thread, one column at a time.
			4) Threading disabled + fast save - all rendering is on the main thread,
				one column at a time, but starting with the top left most changed cell.
    -bug (dkulp) When "Play" hits the bottom of the grid, the "Stop" button wasn't changed back to "Play"

3.6.9	Nov 29, 2014
    -bug (dkulp) Move Text effect rendering back to main thread due GDI calls it makes (to get Font info and to
		render the text) which is required to be done on the main thread.
    -bug (dkulp) Custom models that don't have an element in the grid for all channels in the range would cause
		buffer overruns on ModelExport
    -bug (dkulp) ModelExport was not using the SettingsMap to determine the state of the "Persistent" checkbox
		and instead looked at the actual checkbox on the page.
    -enh (dkulp) MAC - turn off anti-aliased text rendering to make it match Windows (and look better)

    -bug (dkulp) On Mac, could not paste stuff into custom model due to using \r instead of \n for line delimiter
    -enh (dkulp) SPEED: Multi-thread the Nutcracker tab saving to speed up the rendering/saving
    -enh (dkulp) SPEED: Change the internal representation of a color to avoid some unnecessary OS calls.  Results in
                  significantly faster rendering of effects.
    -enh (dkulp) SPEED: Add "Fast Save" option on Nutcracker tab to allow the save command to only render the cells below
                  and to the right of the cells that have changed.  Placing the models you are working on to the
                  right on the grid can significantly speed up turn around time if you flip between Preview and
                  Nutcracker often.

3.6.5	Nov 20, 2014
	-enh (sean) New effect class , Strobe.
	-enh (sean) Icons on top of each effect improved. This icons will be what you drag and drop effects in xLights 4.0. This early introduction

    -enh (dkulp) Add ability to shift columns in the grid left or right to reorder them.
    -enh (dkulp) If the effect is NONE and the buffer is already clear, skip clearing it.  For large Whole House models, clearing the
                buffer can take time so skip it if we can.
    -bug (dkulp)  If the preview is too large for the viewport such that part of the preview was cut off
                at the top, clicking wasn't adjusting the Y coordinate to compensate when determining what
                was being clicked on.
3.6.4	Nov 12, 2014
	-bug (frankr) Fixed playback issue. If you play a sequence in the PREVIEW tab, stop, go and edit some effects in the NUYTCRACKER tab,

3.6.2	Nov 7, 2014
    -enh (dkulp) Tree360 and Tree270 can now specify which strand to use for the first column when exporting and individual model.
                    This allows the exported models to work around issues with the 12:00 first strand for Nutcracker but the first
                    strand is expected to be the 9:00 position in HLS.
	-enh (frankr) New play,pause,stop buttons in PREVIEW screen. Moving the slider plays sequence data and plays sound,

		large objects with no delay.
	-enh (dpitts) New ability to load an image into the background of the PREVIEW tab. There is a brightness slider to dim the image you
		just loaded to give it a dusk time feel.
	-enh (dpitts) New ability to set the resolution of the PREVIEW screen. Set the size and it will be remembered. This is needed to
				help when making Whole House Models. This way you can always come back to the layout you had been working on.

	-bug (frankr) Fix for preview moving some elements into the wrong place. Before the ability to rotate any element
		rotations were in 3 degree increments, now they are 1 degree. This change caused existing previews to draw elements in
		a new position. New code detects old rotation or new rotation values and draws both correctly.
	-bug (frankr) Fixed issue related to  views when switching to new show folder. Under some circumstances, xlights would crash.
3.5.1	Oct 30, 2014
	-bug (dpitts) Found bug that causes crash. Single color models that have multiple lights (think 1 string of single color
		with 50 lights uses 1 channel, but draws 50 places) was not allocating memory correctly for each pseudo light.
	-enh (frankr) Ability added to preview screen, you now can rotate any object not just single string.
3.5.0	Oct 29, 2014
	-enh (dpitts) New button added to the preview screen. This will create a Whole House Model for you automatically.
		There is now a new type of model "Whole House". You no longer need to use spreadsheets and the custom model.
		Procedure: Layout your preview. When everything is correct, press "Create Whole House Model". Give it a name.
		This new whole house model should NOT have "Part of my Display" checked.
		Add the new whole house model as a column in your Nutcracker grid.
		enjoy the new feature, many thanks to Dave Pitts!!

		xlights at launch time.
3.4.24	Oct 28, 2014
	-enh (dpitts) New feature to allow creating views. A view is a collection of models. When you select a view it acts
		like a filter and only shows you the models contained in your view. T
    -enh (dkulp) Star model can now have multiple star size “layers” to model exploding star type things
                     Example: a 100 node star may have 50 for the outer layer, 30 for the middle, 20 for the inner.

	-enh (djulien) Added model CSV export to the Models screen. This csv file can be opened by Excel or
		Open Office spreadsheets
3.4.20	Oct 19, 2014
	-enh (djulien) Added Papagayo Preset stitch (allows Presets to be combined dynamically at run time)
	NOTES:
	 - Papagayo Presets match by model or voice name now rather than column#.  This means they can move around between columns and still work.
	 - The format of the xlights_papagayo.xml file (where pgo Presets are stored) changed but should be backward-compatible.
	 - Custom model info is cached with the Presets; if you change your Custom Models then re-Save the associated Presets
	 - workflow for horizontal (side-by-side) stitch of multiple pgo files + presets is as follows:
	   1. clear grid
	   2. load first pgo file
	   3. select corresponding Preset; this will "bind" the Preset info to the voice(s) in the pgo file
	   4. load next pgo file using "+" button, specify "0" for #frames to shift
	   5. select corresponding Preset
	   6. select output file if not already set
	   7. click button at the bottom to generate the sequence
	   8. load additional pgo files as desired; for vertical stitch (concatenate) enter a non-0 value for #frames to shift

	-enh (djulien) Merged Papagayo sub-tabs; implemented Image option (Movie option TBD); enabled fade on Auto faces; added Copy column button; flattened xlights_papagayo.xml file (old Presets still used for backwards compatibility, but new Presets are written a level higher and merged)
	-bug (djulien) Fixed Papagayo auto-fade; mostly works now, but there seems to still be some flicker (caused by something else within xLights)
	-enh (sean)    New effect class PinWheel. This is NOT working yet, it is a place holder.
3.4.17	Oct 8, 2014
	PRE-RELEASE. There are still bugs we are working in the corofaces code. One we know of , outline does not show in PREVIEW

3.4.4	Jul 2, 2014
	-Bug (dkulp) Fix LOR Import
	The old XML parser, on the start element event, you could query if the element was empty or not.
	For the "channel" element, if it was empty, we skipped it and didn't map it to a channel.
	The new parser doesn't have that functionality.   I have to record some information at the start tag,
	determine if there are any effect child elements, and if not, undo some stuff at the end element.
	The detection and undo wasn't working properly.  Thus, any empty channels in the LMS were getting mapped.
	Why is this a problem?   Well, LMS has a habit of using extra channels for things.
	For example, the CCR's which have 50 pixels would normally just be 150 channels.
	However, in the LMS file, they are 157 channels.  I have no idea what the LR, MM, ME, CM, CS, and CI
	channels that it puts for each CCR are used for.
	In any case, those extra 7 channels (and any other empty channels) would cause large shifts.
	This release has changes to fix that.

		a couple of method names to make them more clear. Also, the timer now skips if the last interval takes more than 50ms to process.
		Before it was blocking until the last interval finished (so if every interval took more than 50ms you had a stackup of waiting timer calls to process).
3.1.0  Aug 7,2013
	- Enhancement: (frankr) new single BACKUP option now.
		Goto to "File,Backup" and every xml file you have will be created in the new Backup sub-directory under show show directory.
		How big are xLight sequences? The xseq file for 12K channels is around 30mbytes, the xml of your sequence is around 30kbytes. As comparison the XML file for LOR for the same song is 800mbytes, for LSP 1.2gbytes. Because xlight sequence files are so small (normally < 50kbytes), we can back them all up quickly.
		How long to back up over 100 sequences? < 1 second.
		How much space does 100 sequences take? < 10 mbytes
		How many times can you do this per day? 1000's.
		How to use this feature? Just do a "File, Backup" before getting new versions.
		I would do a copy if you plan on doing lots of edits.  Basically get yourself protected.
		So after upgrading to 3.1.0, go and make a copy before opening any sequences
	- Enhancement: (Matt Brown) re-engineered the underlying architecture. This is like replacing the galvanized pipe with copper pipe on your home. Takes lots of effort, when you are done the house still looks the same. This re-architecture was needed to allows us to offer new fit to time frame option. With this option effects will be enhanced to do things like start and end exactly to the timing marks on a row. Wait for future releases to see how this is going to help. Trust me, you will like the new things coming.
	- Enhancement: (Matt Brown) has enhanced the preview screen so it is multiple times brighter than before. So much nicer now!!
	- Enhancement: (frankr) made it so that when you select none, it will not overwrite existing data. Why do we care? This enhancement means a LSP person could sequence the first 30 seconds of a megatree (mark those rows as none,none in nutcracker). Now fill the rest of the sequence with nutcracker effects. The result? LSP effects will appear for the first 30 seconds, Nutcracker effects will appear for the remainder.

	- Enhancement: (Sean), For any  person who is pulling code and compiling it (Like MaterDaddy for Linux compiles). I have renamed repository nutcracker_c to be called xLights. Nutcracker_c was just a temp name I was using. I want everyone to remember we started with the xLights code base from Matt Brown in January of this  year. Nutcracker is just one tab on xllights. People get confused is it xLights? Is it Nutcracker? All of nutcracker has been put inside of xLights so the repository should be called the same. Again thanks to Matt for making this all possible. So here is new repository: https://github.com/smeighan/xLights
	- Enhancement: Please start to enter bugs into github so we can track them there. If you want to raise a bug go to https://github.com/smeighan/xLights/issues
	- Bug fix: (Matt) Meteors has been fixed by Matt's rewrite of the preview window. This means the normal Meteor effect is now working again.

	   keyboard.
